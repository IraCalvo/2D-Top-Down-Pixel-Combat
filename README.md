This game is one of my favorite coursework projects I've done. It really captures the feeling of bullet hell games that I personally 
thoroughly enjoy. Within this project there were uses of global lighting, universal shooter script that lets enemy's shoot custom made
projectile patterns, and many more. This was overall an extremely fun class and game.

This game features:
- Universal shooter script
- Oscillating and Staggering within enemy shooter script
- Inventory System
- Friend and Unfriend Projectiles
- Global lighting VFX
- Player dash system
- Sprite Transparency
- Tilemap and tilemap animations
- animations
- destructible objects
- Parallax Effect
- Knockback
- Camera FX
